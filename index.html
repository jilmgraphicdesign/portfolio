		<h3>Client Testimonials</h3>
			<blockquote>
				<p>&ldquo;Jenel worked with me on my company logo (for use on multiple mediums) and created my business cards. Jenel was punctual with deadlines, open to revisions and really understood what we were trying to achieve with our company design. She is very skilled at what she does, from actual design to the details of why certain colors and shapes do or do not work in certain marketing situations. She finished our logo, and then she helped me communicate to the printers the specs I needed for various different cards and promos. The final products were better than I imagined they would be. My experience overall was great, I plan on bringing Jenel in as creative design on future projects.&rdquo;</p>

				<p> &mdash; Adrian Zakrzewski / Production Manager at PRG</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>&ldquo;My husband and I booked Jenel&rsquo;s photography services to do our engagement photos and it is one of the best decisions we&rsquo;ve ever made! Jenel was incredibly collaborative and took time to understand the style of photos we were hoping to get, then expertly executed to give us beautiful photos we will cherish forever. During an engagement photo shoot you spend an uncomfortable amount of time staring into one another&rsquo;s eyes, hugging, and kissing to get the best shots - Jenel kept it fun and made us feel comfortable with her there. Book Jenel for photography - you won&rsquo;t regret it! She&rsquo;s a wonderful artist and will capture some great moments.&rdquo;</p>
